      "options": ["The tree becomes unbalanced", "The node is replaced by its inorder successor", "The node is deleted and the tree shrinks", "None of the above"],
      "answer": "The node is replaced by its inorder successor",
      "hint": "Think about how to maintain the binary search tree property.",
      "explanation": "When removing a node with two children, it's common to replace the node with its inorder successor to maintain the binary search tree property."

      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree?",
      "options": ["Uses a stack", "Uses a queue", "Visits nodes in layers", "Both uses a stack and visits nodes in layers"],
      "answer": "Both uses a stack and visits nodes in layers",
      "hint": "Think about the order of node visits.",
      "explanation": "DFS uses a stack to remember the next vertex to visit and goes as deep as possible down one path before backing up."
